# Diagnosis_of_Alzheimer_Disease
Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease by integrating machine learning and manifold learning using MRI features
# Problem Description
* Alzheimer disease is one of the worst forms of dementia
* Stats show that 1 from 85 people will have Alzheimer by 2050
* It is also estimated that by 2050 that there will be 185 million people affected by Alzheimer
* One diagnostic approach is usage of Magnetic Resonance Images which are processed using manifold and machine learning algorithms
# Dataset Description
Dataset is taken from ADNI (Alzhimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, for link [click here](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) <br /> 
Dataset features include:
* Thickness of brain features
* Standard deviation of brain features
* Surface are of brain features
* Volume of brain features
* Group (Cognatively Normal and Alzheimer Disease)
# Manifold Learning Model Used
* PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
